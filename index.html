            I am currently a student at Seneca College's CPP program. Until a
            few years ago, I was studying economics in Korea, but I fell in love
            with programming and embarked on this new journey. It's only been
            half a year since I started programming, so there are still many
            difficulties and frustrations every day, but if I endure this time,
            I'm looking forward to seeing my growth.

            In retrospect, what bothered me the most this semester was the web
            class. Because I learned C language last semester, the OOP class was
            easier than I thought. However, it was not easy to get used to
            javascript, html, and css because it was the first thing I saw in my
            life. I still faced a lot of problems while working on this project,
            but it makes me happy to be able to create a simple web page
            nonetheless.
