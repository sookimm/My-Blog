            <h2>PILATES</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Pilates is a type of mind-body exercise developed in the early
              20th century by German physical trainer Joseph Pilates, after whom
              it was named. Pilates called his method "Contrology". It is
              practiced worldwide, especially in Western countries such as
              Australia, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. As of
              2005, there were 11 million people practicing the discipline
              regularly and 14,000 instructors in the United States.

            <p><b>Effectiveness </b></p>
            <p>
              In 2015 the Australian Government's Department of Health published
              a meta study which reviewed the existing literature on 17
              alternative therapies including Pilates, in order to determine
              whether any were suitable for being covered by health insurance.
              The review found that due to the small number and methodologically
              limited nature of the existing studies, the effectiveness of
              Pilates is uncertain. Accordingly, in 2017, the Australian
              government named Pilates a practice that would not qualify for
              insurance subsidy, saying this step would "ensure taxpayer funds
              are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking
              evidence".
            </p>
            <p>
              For the treatment of lower back pain, low quality evidence
              suggests that while Pilates is better than doing nothing, it is no
              more effective than other forms of physical exercise. There is
              some evidence regular sessions can help with the conditioning of
              the abdominal muscles of healthy people, when compared to doing no
              exercise. There is no good evidence it helps improve balance in
              elderly people.

            <p><b>Comparison with Yoga</b></p>
            <p>
              Modern yoga, like Pilates, is a mind-and-body discipline, though
              yoga classes are more likely to address spiritual aspects
              explicitly. Some poses are similar in the two disciplines; for
              example, open leg balance closely resembles Navasana, boat pose;
              roll over is similar to Halasana, plough pose; and swan and
              push-up are essentially identical to Bhujangasana, cobra pose and
              Chaturanga Dandasana, low plank pose, respectively. Both
              disciplines develop strength, flexibility, and fitness. Pilates,
              however, emphasises core strength where yoga emphasizes
              flexibility.

            <h2>My Stroy</h2>
            <p>
              I used to be an active person, but lately I spend most of my day
              sitting. Sitting in the wrong posture for a long time causes pain
              in the back and neck. Due to the reduced activity level, even
              though I ate food, it was difficult to digest. But I didn't want
              to exhaust myself from over-exercising. That's why I chose
              Pilates. Pilates isn't a very sweaty workout. However, it has an
              excellent effect on my core muscles and posture correction. There
              are many movements that can be used for light whole-body
              stretching, so I try to do the movements I have learned in my
              spare time at home. I plan to continue doing pilates in the
              future.
